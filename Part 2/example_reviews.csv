The pieces are a little fiddly, and I was disappointed that the figures could only lie-down on the swing, but it didn't concern my granddaughter.  We have since added to the park by buying additional figures and a camping set. It relates to her level of development and interests.  Some people criticise such toys because they claim they leave nothing to the child's imagination, but I disagree: my granddaughter has developed her language skills, imagination, and social skills in playing with this.

Whilst we have lots of Playmobil stuff, I’m pretty sure this is the first product that we’ve had from the City Life range.  It's a bright and colourful set with a very good range of nicely detailed characters and accessory pieces included: There’s the main adventure play area, with a cargo net, ladder, slide, working cradle swing, rocking horse and round-a-bout, a bench seat, shrub, tree (with squirrels, birds and a bird’s nest) and five characters.  Amongst the characters there are two ladies (one of which is with child) and three young children.  Like all Playmobil stuff it requires a fair bit of assembly.  My 8 year old managed this fairly quickly even with his younger brother excitedly trying to help.  There are a lot of smaller pieces with this set - hence the 4-10 age range.  It also comes apart easier than any Playmobil set I can remember, although everything does pop and twist back into place.  I’ve been on my hands and knees several time trying to find the blue and yellow balls that fit on the top of the main play area, and too much pressure on the cradle swing has caused the side of it to collapse on more that one occasion.  Still it’s a good value set for it’s current price of under twenty pounds, and there’s lots of imaginative play possibilities here.",0,7,0,0,RMA6CMBEJXBC7,VINE VOICE

Stick with Lego.,"This hospital play set, is great once it's constructed, very detailed, lots of different rooms and features. However, for a child raised on Lego, it's quite frankly impossible for them to put together. Small plastic clips (about 60 of them) have to be inserted in holes on every piece and despite my help and much pushing painfully down, my 8 year simply couldn't do it, leaving her disappointed and frustrated. Added to this, unlike Lego where you open and go through the bags in order, here the pieces could be anywhere in the entire set of 200+ pieces. Just really disappointing experience. We persevered and got it up and playing but I can't really recommend it because of the awful construction process.

487,B00IF1VVFO,16,4,AH7WJ5577GA6PINIHARIKAMIJXLA,5 January 2016,Brilliant,"This is a great introduction to Play Mobil. Our son is 3 yo so we were concerned at him having a set with too many small parts. I had seen Playmobil 123 for younger children but felt he would grow out of it v quickly as he's already moving on from Duplo to Lego bricks. He's taken to it extremely well! It enables him to engage imaginatively in play using a pretend setting that's familiar to him. Its fairly straightforward to build, although if considering using under recommended age range I would suggest building in advance and gluing some of the smallest parts down (e.g the flowers). It's unfortunate that the manufacturers gender stereotype, with many sets only having mother and child combos. Some male figures in this set would be welcomed!",Verified Purchase,6,0,0,R2S6HPZBGBEFKZ,none

It is a wonderful set up. The children's hospital with its wards and reception is easy to access from the front, and the back. The lift is simple but impressive. I can see that adding extra bits later like an ambulance, helicopter etc will be even more exciting. Hours of fun for my grandchildren assured; as with all Playmobil, exasperating as tidying the hundred of tiny bits pre vacuuming is. For extra realism of course you could have Junior doctors protesting outside the doors, holding placards and a queue of extra Playmobil people snaking out of the door of A&E, Pirates perhaps, injured during their battles!",0,36,12,0,R7DJNIAQ0MMYD,TOP 500 REVIEWER

It’s not that the instructions are difficult to follow, in fact they’re really good, the whole business is just so fiddly. There’s also no apparent rationale to how all the tiny parts have been packaged. You end up with all the internal plastic bags open at once. This maximises the chance of little bits getting lost and means that it takes ages to find the constituents for each relatively small component.",0,0,0,0,R3D3V7D88F26H7,none

Allow a couple of hours, however, and what you're left with is a dolls house like hospital play set with bags of appeal for both adults and children, and some humour too.  This is a free-form set with many small parts, which therefore does lead to a degree of playroom chaos, and which does require some degree of both imaginative play and adult oversight, but neither is a bad thing.  In addition, the modular design allows for this to be combined with expansion sets to bike bigger and better hospital buildings.  All in all, another great toy.",0,0,0,0,R3N64PPFZ7EDZP,none

Although it's a large set, the attention to detail and quality is still second to none. Our 3 year old has been playing with Playmobil for a year or so now, and I'm glad we have just got the hospital, as I don't think it's a set that is practical for under 3's due to the large number of small parts.

As at least one other person has pointed out this does take a while to put together as you literally have to build the hospital, but the pieces are solid and there is an instruction manual to help you.  Obviously with something like this that is quite large I suppose there are only two options, to make it like this, or to have it fully built, but with the latter it would need a much bigger box and would be a pain to pick up in a shop or for posting.  As well as building the hospital you also have to put other things together, such as the wheels on the bed, etc.  This in itself can be a bit of fun as your child or children and partner can also get involved.",0,7,0,0,R1ULCPIT6JDKTB,HALL OF FAME

This is a very large and complex set and it is great fun to build together, but it is not something that small children will be able to do alone. Firstly because of the complexity and secondly because of the size of the small parts. This is a problem if you have children under 3 as there are many parts that they could swallow.

He is always putting daddy on the toilet, and mommy in the kitchen however. Daddy does dishes on occasion thought. The only fault after a few months of play is that when the cord from the sink is pulled out, it does not go back in. So, we have an extra-long dish-washing faucet. All of the silverware can't fit at the table, but if they were any smaller we'd never be able to find them. Product did require some assembly so be sure to do that before giving it to your impatient child. I liked all of the different sleeping and eating options. Very cute details like a camera around the neck for sightseeing and fire extinguishers for safety (they get used with his fire trucks and other toys too).",Verified Purchase,0,0,0,RKUDPE87TYT0Y,none
